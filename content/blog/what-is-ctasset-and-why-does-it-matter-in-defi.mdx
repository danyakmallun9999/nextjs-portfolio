# What is a ctASSET, and Why Does It Matter in DeFi?

## A Simple Definition

A ctASSET is a yield-bearing receipt token you receive when depositing into a Concrete vault.

Think of it like a smart receipt: when you put your assets into a Concrete vault, you get back this special token that not only represents your deposit but also automatically earns yield for you over time.

## Where Do ctASSETs Come From?

Let's break down the process in simple steps:

- You deposit your assets (like USDC, WBTC, or USDT) into a Concrete vault.
- In return, the vault issues you a ctASSET, such as ctUSDC, ctWBTC, or ctUSDT.
- This ctASSET acts as your proof of ownership, representing your share of the vault's assets plus any yield it generates.

It's straightforward – no complicated setups required. The vault handles the heavy lifting, optimizing your deposit through automated DeFi strategies to earn returns.

## Why Are ctASSETs Important?

What sets ctASSETs apart from regular deposit receipts in traditional finance or even basic DeFi vaults? Here's the key difference:

- **They Earn Yield Automatically**: Unlike static receipts, ctASSETs grow in value as the vault earns yield from DeFi opportunities.
- **They Can Increase in Value Over Time**: As the vault performs, your ctASSET appreciates, reflecting the accumulated earnings.
- **They Represent Active DeFi Strategies**: These aren't just idle holdings; they're tied to smart, managed strategies that put your capital to work.
- **They Turn Idle Capital into Active Capital**: Instead of your money sitting dormant, ctASSETs make it productive, unlocking efficiency in DeFi.

In essence, ctASSETs bridge the gap between earning and using your assets, making DeFi more powerful and user-friendly.

## What Can You Do With a ctASSET?

ctASSETs are versatile, designed to be more than just a holding token. Here are some key use cases:

- **Hold and Earn Yield**: Simply keep your ctASSET in your wallet, and watch it compound automatically without any extra effort.
- **Trade or Swap**: Exchange your ctASSET on decentralized exchanges for other assets, capturing its value at any time.
- **Provide Liquidity**: Use it in liquidity pools to earn additional fees while still benefiting from the underlying yield.
- **Use as Collateral or Leverage**: Borrow against your ctASSET or leverage it in lending protocols to amplify your positions.
- **Power Future Structured Products**: Integrate it into advanced DeFi products, like derivatives or cross-chain strategies, for even more opportunities.

These features make ctASSETs a "money lego" – a modular building block that stacks with other DeFi tools.

## How ctASSETs Fit Into “One-Click DeFi”

ctASSETs are at the heart of Concrete's vision for "One-Click DeFi," simplifying the complex world of decentralized finance:

- **One Deposit → One ctASSET**: A single action gets you exposure to optimized yield strategies.
- **No Managing Multiple Positions**: Forget juggling various protocols; the vault automates everything.
- **No Manual Compounding**: Earnings are reinvested automatically, maximizing growth without your intervention.
- **No Strategy Switching**: The vault adapts to the best opportunities, so you don't have to monitor or adjust.

This approach democratizes DeFi, making high-yield strategies accessible to everyone, from beginners to experts.
